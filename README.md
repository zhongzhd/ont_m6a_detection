## 1 preprocess:
basecalling and alignment

## 2 m6A detection:
These ONT tools were executed with appropriate parameters to output results of all sites in RRACH motifs (coverage >= 5).

## 3 postprocess:
The results of each tool were organized into a standard format:  
transcript pos score coverage id motif  
ENSMUST00000000001.4	63	0.478300	27	ENSMUST00000000001.4|63	AGACC

## 4 coordinate_transformationï¼š
The transcriptome coordinates were converted to the genomic coordinates. Sites derived from multiple transcriptomic coordinates but aligned to the same genomic coordinate were merged as following: for Tombo/Tombo_com, MINES, Nanom6A, m6Anet and Epinano/Epinano_delta, the scores (fraction-modified/probability-modified) were weighted averaging according coverage; for Nanocompore, Xpore, DiffErr, DRUMMER and ELIGOS, the best scores (p-value/z score) were selected as representative.

## 5 continuous_evaluation_metrics:
plot ROC and PR curves

## 6 optimal_cut-off_selection:
The optimal cut-off of each tool for m6A detection was determined by varing cut-offs and calculated F1 scores.
